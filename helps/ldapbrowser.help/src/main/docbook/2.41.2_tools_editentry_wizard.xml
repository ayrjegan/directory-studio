	<title>Edit Entry wizard</title>
	<para>
		This wizard helps you to edit an entry offline. You could make
		multiple modifications, when finishing the wizard all your 
		modifications are sent to the directory in one request. This
		wizard is especially helpful when adding additional object
		classes which require additional attributes.
	</para>

	<para>
		To start the wizard choose <emphasis role="strong">Edit Entry...</emphasis>
		from the Entry editor's context menu or use the 
		<shortcut><keycap>F8</keycap></shortcut> shortcut.
	</para>

	<para>
		The wizard is also the default value editor for the objectClass attribute,
		so you could also start the wizard by editing the objectClass attribute. 
	</para>
