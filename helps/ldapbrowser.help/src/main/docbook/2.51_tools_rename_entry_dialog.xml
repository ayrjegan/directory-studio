	<title>Rename Entry dialog</title>
	<para>
		The Rename Entry dialog is used to rename an entry. 
		In detail the relative distinguished name (RDN) is modified by sending a 
		modrdn operation to the directory.
	</para>
	
	<para>
		To start the Rename Entry dialog select the entry you want to rename, then 
		choose <emphasis role="strong">Rename...</emphasis> from context menu
		or press <shortcut><keycap>F2</keycap></shortcut>.
	</para>	
	
	<para>
		Note 1: Some directories don't support renaming whole trees but only
		renaming of leaf entries. In that case you are ask if you want to
		simulate the rename operation, this is done by copying the whole
		tree and deleting the old tree afterwards.
	</para>
	
	<para>
		Note 2: It is not possible to rename the Root DSE.
