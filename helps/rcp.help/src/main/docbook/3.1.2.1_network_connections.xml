		1. The SOCKS proxy support in Java 1.4 had certain limitations.
		Due to these limitations, the setting of the SOCKS system
		properties is not performed when a 1.4 VM is used. The SOCKS
		proxy may still be used by some tooling when running on a 1.4 VM
		(e.g. CVS). However, users should use a 1.5 (or 5.0) VM if they
		require full SOCKS proxy support.
