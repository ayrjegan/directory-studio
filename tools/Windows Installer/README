The windows_install.nsi script creates the Windows installer for a release of Apache Directory Studio on Windows.

To create a Windows installer, you have to put in a "release" folder the following files:
  * Apache Directory Studio.exe (the application)
  * LICENSE.txt
  * NOTICE.txt
  * Release Notes.txt

Then, you can compile the script with NSIS.

An "Apache_Directory_Studio_VERSION_Windows.exe" installer will be generated.
